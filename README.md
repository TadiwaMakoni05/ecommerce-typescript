# 🛒 E-Commerce Website

A modern e-commerce application built with **React.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This project fetches product data with pagination from a **dummy API** and implements global state management using the **Context API**.

This was my first time working with **TypeScript**, and it helped me practice typing in a React app, along with efficient data fetching and pagination.
